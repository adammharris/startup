# ShowBrain

[My Notes](notes.md)



## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you ever have so much to say that you wish you could justâ€¦ take your brain out and show someone? ShowBrain can help! It's like Facebook but for longform text content. (And without feeds and privacy issues.) It's a website that takes a collection of personal files (for example, class notes, or a digital journal) and helps you safely publish them for friends to see and comment on. By default, all files are private, and access levels are easy to configure: for example, allow your coworkers to access one set of files, allow your family to access all of those plus some more, let one specific friend have access to one specific file, and so forth.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

Here is a rough sequence diagram that shows how ShowBrain works. It is essentially a social media/blogging application, but with a focus on small groups and personal utility rather than making lots of things known to the public.

    participant NewSite
    Admin->>ShowBrain: Admin logs into ShowBrain and creates a new site
    ShowBrain->>NewSite: Creates NewSite with admin "Admin"
    NewSite-->>Admin: Admin access to NewSite
    Admin->>NewSite: Upload files and assign access levels
    NewSite-->>Admin: Unique links to files and "blog format"
    Friend->>ShowBrain: Registers on ShowBrain
    Friend->>NewSite: Accesses NewSite through ShowBrain account
    NewSite-->>Friend: Automatically assigned "Public" access level
    NewSite-->>Admin: Shows that user has joined NewSite
    NewSite-->>Friend: Public files and comments
    Admin->>NewSite: Assigns friend access level of "Friend"
    NewSite-->>Friend: Receives access level "Friend"
    Friend->>NewSite: Accesses NewSite with ShowBrain account
    NewSite-->>Friend: Files and comments with "Public" and "Friend" access levels
    Friend->>NewSite: Comments on files
    NewSite-->>Admin: Comments made visible via WebSocket
```

### Key features

- Secure register/login over HTTPS
- Upload personal documents/digital journal to publish them online
- Set and fine-tune access levels for each file or collection of files
- Allow friends to register, get assigned an access level, and stay connected by interacting with your documents

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provides the basic structure of the page, including the Home, Login, Public, Contact, and Help pages.
- **CSS** - Helps website adjust to fit any device and look nice
- **React** - Facilitates authentication and adjusts files that are shown based on the account's access level
- **Service** - Upload documents, assign access levels, publish to unique links, register/login to see files of different access levels
- **DB/Login** - If a user does not login, they can see all files given the "public" access level. If they do, they can be assigned further access levels by the author so they can see more files.
- **WebSocket** - Commenting, liking, etc.
